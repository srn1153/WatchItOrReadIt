# WatchItOrReadIt

<h2>Project Description</h2>
Entertainment social network platforms like Letterboxd and Goodreads have become recognised for their user-friendly interfaces and interactive communities where users can share their options, participate in discussions and discover new entertainment. Building on these concepts, WatchItOrReadIt aims to combine the best features of both platforms into a seamless moible application. Allowing users to experience a fictional world through movies, tv shows and books. 
<br />

<h2>Features within our app</h2>
The app is designed to help users explore new content — be it films, TV series and books —  based on their preferences, community interaction and recommendation systems. With features such as:

- Account creation & login
- Discovery features - Popular films, Trending TV Shows, Best Books
- Search by Films, Books, TV Series and users
- Dedicated details page for the 3 medias
- Personalized Recommendations
- Reviews
- Favourites - dedicated shelves for your top 4 Books, Movies & shows
- Personalized Profile Rooms - decorate your interactive room to reflect your own taste

Our app consists of a login/signup screen to allow users to create accounts within our app. The users are then directed to our home screen where they can discover popular movies, tv shows and books. There is a navigation bar along the bottom of the screen, allowing users to navigate between the home screen, search screen and profile room with ease. The app has a built-in search bar where users can filter through 3 different medias: movies, tv shows and books, as well as a section to look up other users. Once media is discover, users can be directed to its specific details screen. This detail screen contains information to the specified media, a review button, a star rating and more recommendations. Lastly, our profile room, users start off with an empty (default) profile room where they can customize their room to their individual liking. This is done by tapping the decorate button (hammer) where users can customize different parts of their profile room such as their furniture and room decor. Users can also click on the tv or book shelf icon. These icons allow users to add their top movies/tv shows (tv icon) or book (bookshelf icon) to showcase to other users and keep track of their all time favourites.
